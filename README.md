# fps - First Person Raycaster
Raycaster made by me, algorithms inspired by online sources.

* Uses C++ and SDL 2
* No support for Windows, sorry
* Add support for Windows if you want to be a legend
* I haven't tested it on Linux, but it might work.
* `make` to compile. Comment the `--debug` in like the third line of the makefile and then `make redo` to get a non-debug binary, which might be a bit faster.
